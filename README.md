# AppTemplate for android
This is the android app template using dagger2 + mvp design.
I'm going to add some more samples

What I'm planning to organize for this app is the structure of android application that supports
 - basically dagger2 with MVP android app design.
 - Realm
 - SQLite
 - Retrofit
 - RxJava

This is the target architecture of this app.

It doesn't have much interesting features right now. Only templates.
But I will update more samples.
